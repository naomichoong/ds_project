    "# Assessing Vocal Measurements to Predict Parkinson’s Disease\n",
    "\n",
    "Group 6 proposal: Naomi Choong, Yashas Ganesh Prasad, Braydon Newman, Marylyn Yuwono\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction: \n",
    "Parkinson’s Disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder impairing motor abilities, is characterized by tremors, stiffness, and slowed movements. Many individuals with PD also experience voice problems including abnormal voice quality, volume and pitch (Ma et al., 2020). Evidence shows vocal changes manifest during the prodromal phase of PD, prior to onset of clinical symptoms and diagnosis (Harel et al., 2004). This suggests that vocal measurements may be a potential biomarker to detect early stage PD. Early detection and treatment can slow disease progression and may help mitigate symptoms. \n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate potential vocal biomarkers of PD, we aim to answer the following question: **Can acoustic measurements of voice predict Parkinson’s disease based on voice recordings?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will analyze a dataset of various acoustic measurements from vocal recordings of 31 subjects. Data was collected by Little et al. (2009). An average of 6 recordings of sustained vowel phonation were taken for each subject.  Each row in the dataset corresponds to one voice recording from a subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gargmanas/parkinsonsdataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "To examine the predictive potential of acoustic measurements, we will use the K-nearest neighbors classification algorithm. Variables were selected based on past literature, showing patients with PD had higher jitter, shimmer, and pitch variability, and reduced harmonics to noise ratio compared to healthy subjects (Jiménez-Jiménez et al., 1997; Ma et al., 2020). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables used:\n",
    "- `status` - health status of subject; Parkinson’s = 1, healthy =0\n",
    "- `MDVP:Jitter (abs)` - absolute jitter in microseconds (variation in frequency)\n",
    "- `Shimmer:DDA` - local shimmer in decibels (variation in amplitude)\n",
    "- `PPE` - pitch period entropy (variation in pitch)\n",
    "- `HNR` - harmonics-to-noise ratio (quantifies amount of additive noise in voice)\n"
